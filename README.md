## Distances and Angles between Images (Inner products and angles)
We are going to compute distances and angles between images.

## Mean/covariance of a dataset + effect of a linear transformation
We will now look at computing means and (co)variances of data sets and the effect of linear transformations of the data sets on the mean and covariance. For this, we will write some code snippets.<br>

## Orthogonal projections
In this project, we will implement orthogonal projection which projects data onto lower-dimensional subspaces. We will then apply this to the problem of "eigenfaces" which will help us understand the application of orthogonal projection in the real world.
